* implement byes
* make tables index from zero
* further cleanup of output from both player and tournament modules
    - Table listings should be by last name and duplicated
* maybe encapsulte tables in their own class?
* maybe store tables in the tournament class as an array of arrays?
* the helper functions for player sorting are backwards but otherwise correct.
